      <p>We believe that business should have a visible purpose for the common good. Financial markets, well directed, can have a profoundly positive impact in promoting a sustainable world without which we will not have a long term sustainable business.</p>

      <p>Lykke shapes the future by democratising finance. We open-source our work and consciously try to put people, planet and profit in that order.</p>

      <p>We level the playing field by building secure marketplaces for any type of asset with direct ownership and immediate settlement. Transformative as this is, our vision is broader -  We believe that imagination and technology, creatively applied, can help solve our social and environmental challenges.</p>

      <p>By tokenizing value,capturing externalities that mostly go unaccounted for, and creating tradeable currencies with purpose like SolarCoin and Trees, Lykke is enabling widespread access to new markets for large-scale and small-scale investors.</p>
      
      <p>Imagine a world where the bottom billion have financial identities, remittances and aid is directly distributed, land rights are transparent and supply chains verified where financial instruments are in service of the poorest. </p>

      <p>This and more become possible with blockchain technology like ours - a sustainable future is within our grasp. </p>
