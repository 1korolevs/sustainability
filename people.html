      <p>Sustainability is a choice actively made by people for people.It requires leadership and vision.
Lykke’s founders Richard Olsen, Sergey Ivliev and Anton Gulab; "We  see it as part of our DNA and want it embedded in our thinking across our business. When we hire we care not only that people have world class skills, but that they see themselves in service of their colleagues, our customers and the greater good".</p>

<p>It is paradoxical that technology that seems so impersonal, can be directed to making finance personal and inclusive and help lift people out of poverty. We’ve made opening a Lykke wallet 
easy and secure,with a vision that eventually anyone with a smartphone, rich or poor can own how their money is received, spent, invested and protected without expensive intermediaries.</p>

<p>As part of our commitment to realizing the SDGs, where blockchain offers fresh solutions, we are building partnerships to incentivise impact investment and the more efficient use of capital. eg. supply chains that are  transparent and trafficking free, secure wallets and financial identities for refugees, cheaper worldwide payments and remittances, enabling microlending, insurance and trackable social payments like Universal Basic Income.</p>

<p>The financial empowerment of women is a priority. Not only do women  represent $18trillion in purchasing power,but there is strong evidence of the cascade benefits to children and to society. </p>

<p>More broadly we agree that feminine values are ‘the operating system of the 21st Century*,  says Inge Relph, Head of Sustainability. We know we can’t change systems that are so interdependent without collaboration.</p>

 <p>Lykke is working on gender balance in our own workforce. Head of HR, Federica Gasparini; “ I was impressed to see that ‘putting family first was in employee agreements  - pretty unusual for a finance company! Now we are working on attracting  more women into fintech”.</p>
