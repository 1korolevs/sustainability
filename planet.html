      <p>Since the landmark Paris and SDG agreements in 2015, there has been unprecedented mobilisation and innovation by the public and private sectors around curbing greenhouse gas emissions and the destruction of the natural and social fabric essential to continued sustainable existence on our planet.</p>
<p>There has been unprecedented mobilisation and innovation around achieving these goals by both the public and private sectors. The key to unlocking finance has been putting an accurate price on the harm done (negative externalities) and valuing natural capital such as forests, water, and biodiversity as assets worth protecting</p>
 <p>With our blockchain based systems, wallets and trading platform, Lykke has pioneered the creation of traceable, transparent, and tradeable tokens representing natural assets such as SolarCoin and TREE. These tokens are listed on our exchange, accessible by both retail and institutional investors.We will be adding to these in coming months, along with listing companies that provide measurable eco services such as peer to peer energy systems, micro grids and innovations in protecting animal and natural biodiversity. Our vision is to make it easy for individuals and asset managers alike, to build portfolios and invest in the things that make the world sustainable.</p>
